                Prepare to take off and fly high with our Sky Experience
                available every day of the year. Our charter flight and hot air
                balloon rides offer the perfect combination of thrills and
                relaxation to do in couple and in small groups. You will be
                surrounded by the most amazing landscape and colours,
                picturesque and tranquil. You hear very little sound from the
                awakening world below. The silence is only broken with blasts
                from the small but powerful airplane or the propane burner
                heating the air in your balloon to keep you cruising across the
                skies for longer. Watch as the sun bursts from the horizon and
                paints the sky pink in a spectacular morning sunrise. Your
                adventure begins in the cooler, still hours of the early
                morning, when the air is more stable. Then it’s time to clamber
                into the wicker basket and gently rise, as the burner heats the
                air inside the balloon. Our 30-minute and 60-minute flights are
                available over our Parks’ area and beyond. Our 30-minute and

                Get ready to be blown away by our Fire Experience accessible
                every day of the year!<br />
                You will see a variety of glowing volcanic phenomena, like
                fascinating lakes of steaming acid, thundering steam vents,
                frothing pits of boiling mud, steaming volcanic streams, bright
                oranges and yellows resulting from all the accumulated sulphur
                on the island make for great photos, so make sure your camera is
                at hand! Our great park staff will provide you with a safety

                experiences, prior to going on a guided walk to inspect the
                geothermal gems of the Park. Since most of the volcano’s bulk is
                underwater, you won’t be doing much climbing, if at all, before
                heading straight to the action. During our Fire Experience tour,
                you may encounter marine and land wildlife on your journey. So,
                keep your eyes peeled as you listen to helpful commentary from
                your skipper and crew. What are you waiting for? Fire up your
                next holiday and book your next glowing Fire Experience online!
